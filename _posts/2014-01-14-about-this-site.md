This site is a utility for Jekyll theme development. This instance provides a default set of dummy content, which can be forked for developing themes. The dummy content will help you be able to test your theme design against real (dummy) content.

Content is all in the public domain.

You can find the project to fork on [GitHub here](https://github.com/jglovier/jekyll-dummy-content/).
