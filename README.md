jekyll-dummy-content
====================

Jekyll-dummy-content is for starting new jekyll themes with placeholder content. It contains a range of different content scenarios (long posts, short posts, long titles, short titles, etc) for testing layouts in realistic scenarios, and fringe scenarios.

There are no customizations to the jekyll theme itself, it's literally just the default `jekyll new` site with a bunch of dummy posts.

[Preview it here](http://joelglovier.com/jekyll-dummy-content/), or just fork and start building or testing your theme!
